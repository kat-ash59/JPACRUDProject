# JPACRUDProject

This project grew out of a desire for me to wrangle all of my knitting needles, crochet hooks and cables.  I have way to many of them and would like a way to keep track of them all in one place so that I will not have a OMG I don't have one of those moments.  I will be able to hop on my page and find out what I have in my stash of goodies.
